Emily inserted the key into the lock, and to her surprise, it clicked and the gate swung open.
She walked up the overgrown path to the mansion's entrance and tried the key on the door
To her surprise it worked there also

The mansion was dark and dusty, but she could see that it was once a grand and beautiful place
She came across a locked chest. She wondered if this key could open everything

1-She tries the key on the chest
2-She felt uneasy and did not try the key on the lock

checkpoint 3
(checkpoint = 3, choice = 1[21])
The key fit perfectly in the lock, and the chest creaked open. It was weird that this was happening for every lock.
Inside, Emily found a small, intricately crafted music box. When she wound it up and opened it, it played a hauntingly
beautiful melody that filled the room.
As she listened, she noticed that the music seemed to be coming from a specific direction.
She followed the sound a hidden door and wondered if she should go through it or not.

At this point she began to feel uncomfortable

1-And decided not to go through the hidden door
2-But decided to go through the hidden door regardless

(checkpoint = 4, choice = 2[31])
Emily cautiously opened the door and found a staircase leading down into a dark, musty basement. She could hear the music getting louder
and her curiosity got the better of her as she descended the stairs
At the bottom of the stairs, she found a room filled with old musical instruments. In the center of
the room, she saw a strange-looking instrument that she had never seen before. She wondered if she should try to play it or not.
At this point she began to feel really uneasy

checkpoint 5
(checkpoint = 5, choice = 1[42])
Emily picked up the instrument and began to play. At first, the music was beautiful, but then it began to change.
The melody became more and more discordant, and Emily started to feel a strange sensation in her head
Suddenly, the room began to spin, and everything went black. When she woke up, she was back outside the mansion, lying in the grass
She felt disoriented and confused, wondereing if everything she had experienced was just a dream.
Did she even go inside in the first place ? Emily

1-Decided it was just a dream
2-Wanted to verify whether she went in or not

(checkpoint = 5, choice = 2[42])
Emily decided to go back home but when she turned to leave she began to feel light-headed.
When she woke up, she found that she had been transported to another dimension and she did not know how to get back home.

checkpoint 6
(checkpoint = 6, choice = 1[51])
Emily went back home conviced that it had all been a dream. However, she couldn't shake the feeling that there was
something she had missed and she often found herself daydreaming about the mysterious mansion.
One day she decided to go back to mansion to explore and it was nowhere to be found.
It had simply disappeared from existence

....................The end....................

(checkpoint = 6, choice = 2[51])
Emily refused to believe that she had been dreaming and she decided to investigate the mansion further and found
a room filled with valuable treasures. She used the money she earned from selling them to travel the world and have many adventures.
Sometimes she wondered what would have happened if she just assumed she was just dreaming that day.

checkpoint 7 
(checkpoint = 7, choice = 1[12])
As Emily went to back to search for the key she had a feeling that she was being watched
When she arrived at where she saw the key at first, the key was not there anymore
The hairs on the back of her head stood up. She just decided to go home and quickened her pace, her heart was pounding

Suddenly she heard a voice whisper her name, "Emily". She turned around but there is no one and she felt
a cool breeze brush against her cheeks, and a sense of unease washed over her
She took a deep breath

1-And followed the sound
2-And kept walking

(checkpoint = 7, choice = 2[12])
As she continued walking she stumbled upon a small cottage that was abandoned and looked as if it had not been inhabited for years.
Curiosity got the best of her, and she decided to explore the cottage.
As she entered the cottage, she found an old dusty book on the shelf. It seemed to be a spell book.
Emily was fascinated by the book and decided to take it with her. 

That night Emily started reading the spell book and found a spell that promised to grant any wish. The spell required a rare and hard-to-find herb
Determined to get her wish Emily set out to find the herb
As Emily was walking through the woods she saw a rabbit with a golden fur. The rabbit ran into a bush
