Inheritance in C++ is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows a class (called the **derived class**) to inherit properties and behaviors (data members and member functions) from another class (called the **base class**). This promotes code reuse, reduces redundancy, and supports the concept of hierarchical classification.

### Key Concepts of Inheritance in C++
1. **Base Class**: The class whose properties and methods are inherited.
2. **Derived Class**: The class that inherits from the base class.

### Syntax of Inheritance
```cpp
class BaseClass {
    // Members of the base class
};

class DerivedClass : accessSpecifier BaseClass {
    // Members of the derived class
};
```

### Access Specifiers
When inheriting from a base class, you use an **access specifier** to control the visibility of base class members in the derived class:
1. **public**: Public and protected members of the base class remain public and protected in the derived class.
2. **protected**: Public and protected members of the base class become protected in the derived class.
3. **private**: Public and protected members of the base class become private in the derived class.

### Types of Inheritance
C++ supports multiple types of inheritance:
1. **Single Inheritance**: A derived class inherits from a single base class.
   ```cpp
   class Base {
       // Base class members
   };

   class Derived : public Base {
       // Derived class members
   };
   ```

2. **Multilevel Inheritance**: A class inherits from a derived class.
   ```cpp
   class Base {
       // Base class members
   };

   class Intermediate : public Base {
       // Intermediate class members
   };

   class Derived : public Intermediate {
       // Derived class members
   };
   ```

3. **Multiple Inheritance**: A class inherits from more than one base class.
   ```cpp
   class Base1 {
       // Base1 class members
   };

   class Base2 {
       // Base2 class members
   };

   class Derived : public Base1, public Base2 {
       // Derived class members
   };
   ```

4. **Hierarchical Inheritance**: Multiple derived classes inherit from a single base class.
   ```cpp
   class Base {
       // Base class members
   };

   class Derived1 : public Base {
       // Derived1 class members
   };

   class Derived2 : public Base {
       // Derived2 class members
   };
   ```

5. **Hybrid Inheritance**: A combination of two or more types of inheritance, often involving multiple and hierarchical inheritance.

### Example of Single Inheritance
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Base {
public:
    void show() {
        cout << "This is the base class." << endl;
    }
};

class Derived : public Base {
public:
    void display() {
        cout << "This is the derived class." << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Derived obj;
    obj.show();    // Accessing base class function
    obj.display(); // Accessing derived class function
    return 0;
}
```

### Important Notes
1. **Accessing Base Class Members**: Private members of the base class are not accessible directly in the derived class, even though they are inherited. They can be accessed through public or protected methods of the base class.
2. **Constructors and Destructors**: Constructors and destructors are not inherited but are called in a specific order:
   - The base class constructor is called first.
   - The derived class constructor is called next.
   - For destructors, the derived class destructor is called first, followed by the base class destructor.
3. **Virtual Inheritance**: Used to avoid the "diamond problem" in multiple inheritance.
